# My First lines of code

This repository contains some of the very first lines of code I wrote about 6 years ago when I first started learning to code in Code Academy Kids HTML course. While the code is very far from perfect, it serves as a reminder that everyone starts somewhere, and with dedication, progress can be made. Sadly, a lot of code was lost because noone told me that I should use github :(
